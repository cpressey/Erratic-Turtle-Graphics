Erratic Turtle Graphics
=======================

A gewgaw that I prototyped in 2018 sometime I think.  I don't
remember when I had the original idea, but I think it was not
long before that.

And that idea is: turtle graphics, except there's a small
margin of error.  You might ask for "Turn right 90 degrees"
but you might get only "Turn right 89.91 degrees".

If you use a faint pen, and repeat the drawing instructions
many times over, you get a nice pencilly noisy effect.
